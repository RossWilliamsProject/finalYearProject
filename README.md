# finalYearProject

This is the code I used for the year 3 project for my Computer Science Degree.

There are three application prototypes stored in the repository - 
Prototype A: No Gamification Features
Prototype B: Extrinsic Gamification Features (Leader board, Quizzes, Points, Badges)
Prototype C: Intrinsic Gamification Features (Narrration)

THIS IS PROTOTYPE C

Link To Repo: https://github.com/RossWilliamsProject/finalYearProject
The three prototypes are stored on seperate branches of the repository named 
"PrototypeA", "PrototypeB", and "PrototypeC"
(PLEASE NOTE: The "Main" branch contains nothing of interest)

Program was developed using an agile methodology with the use of a kanban style board with short sprints. 
Sprint details can be found on the trello board: https://trello.com/b/ZOu7ojxX/psyrw5-project

To Run the code:
    - After downloading code and opening terminal to code location.
    - First install "node.js" and "expo".
    - Create a new expo project using "expo init my-app" in terminal, renavigate to new file.
    - Place downloaded code into new expo project file.
    - Run "npm install --global expo-cli" in a terminal to install expo client.
    - Run "expo install" in a terminal to install program depedencies.
        (List of dependancies can be found in "package.json" file)
    - Run "npm start" in terminal to run the application in expo-CLI.
    - When expo-CLI opens in browser, scan the QR code to run on a mobile device, or run using an emulator. 

Expo can be used to create an APK to install and run as a standalone application, however, 
running in "expo go" is enough for temporary prototype usage for research, so APK generation wasnt tested.
